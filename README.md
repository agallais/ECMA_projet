#ECMA_projet
This project is part of the grade in one of my courses. It is about finding a heuristic to eficiently solve the General Assignment Problem.

This is a well known problem in Operation Research, and as you may know the problem quickly becomes impossible to solve by the classical branch-and-bound method, requiring a heuristic approach.


I wil first try to solve the problem via a tabu search heuristic, then I will try a lagrangian relaxation / column generation if time.

Don't hesitate to e-mail me about the project or the way I write the code : aymeri.gallais@gmail.com

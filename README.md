#ECMA_projet
This project is part of the grade in one of my courses. It is about finding a heuristic to eficiently solve the General Assignment Problem.

This is a well known problem in Operation Research, and as you may know the problem quickly becomes impossible to solve by the classical branch-and-bound method, requiring a heuristic approach.
